<h1>Diligence's SEO Feature</h1>

<p>
	This feature helps you comply with a few de-facto search engine standards to improve your interaction with them, specifically
	robots.txt and sitemap.xml.
</p>
<p>
	At first glance, there's nothing very sophisticated about these standards, and you might be tempted to create the required text
	files manually and then serve them statically. However, large applications with many URLs can easily have unweildy site maps.
	This Diligence feature helps you create them and manage them fairly automatically. It supports <i>very, very large</i> site maps.
</p>
<p>
	Refer to the <a href="<%= conversation.pathToBase %>/api/?namespace=Diligence.SEO">Diligence.SEO API documentation</a>
	for more details.
</p>


<h2>The Goods</h2>
<h3>robots.txt</h3>
<p>
	Search engines expect to find this resource right at the root of your domain.
	Its <a href="http://www.robotstxt.org/robotstxt.html">plain text content</a> tells them where to find your sitemap URL,
	and can also control the crawling of your domain.
</p>
<p>
	Your robots.txt will likely not be very dynamic. Because it matches URLs starting with stated URLs, it can easily
	cover large sections of your site, and require infrequent tweaking.
</p>	
<p>
	When would you need a lot of robots.txt tweaking? A common case for large sites is that public resources are deprecated or
	otherwise cancelled. In such cases you still want to keep them up for reference, and to allow hyperlinks elsewhere on the
	web to still be able to reach them -- there's SEO value in that. But, you do not want these resources to appear in search
	engines and confuse users (you want them to find the new, better resources). A robots.txt exclusion would do the trick.
</p>	

<h3>sitemap.xml</h3>
<p>
	If your robots.txt doesn't state otherwise, then this resource will also be at the root of your domain.
	Its <a href="http://sitemaps.org/protocol.php">XML content</a> can either list URLs directly, or,
	more commonly, act as the primary index of other XML files called URL sets.
</p>
<p>
	Search engines do take site maps seriously. A carefully maintained site map would
	help them keep up to date with your dynamic site, in turn helping to get human searchers to the
	page they want (or the page you want them to want...). It's likely this would indirectly and directly
	improve your ranking, too.
</p>

<h2>Live Demo</h2>
<p>
	To see what it looks like, we've installed the SEO feature under this application. Though,
	you'll probably usually install it under the root application (see below). The site map
	is also being generated in dynamic mode, which is the default (again, see below).  
</p>
<p>	
	<a href="<%= conversation.pathToBase %>/robots.txt">See the robots.txt</a>
</p>
<p>
	<a href="<%= conversation.pathToBase %>/sitemap.xml">See the sitemap.xml</a>
</p>


<h2>Dynamic or Static?</h2>
<p>
	URL sets can grow to be very large (think: Wikipedia), so search engines have put limits on file size:
	50,000 URLs per file and 10MB, uncompressed. That's right, you're allowed to compress your site map files
	with gzip to save bandwidth. There doesn't seem to be a limit on the number of files you can serve,
	so potentially your site map can be as big as needed.
</p>
<p>
	Diligence supports two ways of generating site map resources: dynamic (via /web/fragments/) and static (via
	/web/static/). Dynamic is the default, and should be fine for small web sites. It generates robots.txt
	and sitemap.xml on demand, using Prudence's standard caching to keep things smooth and fast.
</p>
<p>
	But, dynamic mode does not support more than 50,000 URLs per URL set. What's more, it generates these
	within the HTTP request thread. So, you definitely do not want to use dynamic mode for large sites, or sites
	which are slow to generate the URL sets! If you do, each time you get hit by a search engine for
	the site map (can happen several times a day for "hot" sites!) a web request thread will be tied up for the length
	of time it takes to generate the huge URL set. There are two problems for this: first and worst, the search engine
	may penalize you for being so slow, and second, even if you are caching agressively, it means that you will
	occasionally have one <i>very</i> heavy request, breaking the ironclad rules laid out in Prudence's
	<a href="http://threecrickets.com/prudence/scaling/">Scaling Tips</a> article. 
</p>
<p>
	Static mode can support URL sets of any size: it works by generating all required files in an
	asynchronous Prudence task so that they can take as much time as necessary, without tying up
	any user thread. You can set the task to run via Prudence's crontab: once a day, twice a day, etc.
	The task makes sure to split URL sets into "pages" of 50,000 URLs max, and to gzip compress
	them. It even makes sure to generate them in a separate spool directory, and then swap
	them all at once, so that search engines hitting your site exactly during site map generation
	don't see a partial, inconsistent picture. And it all happens asynchronously, using Diligence tasks,
	so that multiple URL sets can be generated simultaneously. And, of course, since they are plain
	old files, you can also host them outside of Prudence.
</p>
<p>
	Note that robots.txt is always generated dynamically: its size limit is 100KB, which should
	be manageable. The implication is that you can't go crazy with very large lists of
	exclusions/inclusions. If this is an issue, you can use
	<a href="http://www.robotstxt.org/meta.html">meta tags</a> instead.
</p>


<h2>Instruction Manual</h2>
<p>
	Every application in your Prudence instance can have its own URL sets, but it only makes sense for the
	root application to have both robots.txt and sitemap.xml. We'll start our guide with an application
	that is <i>not</i> the at root, because it's simpler.
</p>
<p>
	From our settings.js: 
</p>	
<pre>
predefinedGlobals = Sincerity.Objects.flatten({
	diligence: {
		feature: {
			seo: {
				domains: [{
					rootUri: 'http://localhost:8080'
				}, {
					rootUri: 'http://threecrickets.com'
				}],
				locations: [{
					name: 'the-real-thing',
					domains: ['http://localhost:8080', 'http://threecrickets.com'],
					locations: ['/happy/', '/this/', '/is/', '/working/'],
					exclusions: ['/diligence/media/', '/diligence/style/', '/diligence/script/'],
					inclusions: ['/diligence/media/name/'],
					factory: 'Explicit'
				}, {
					name: 'test',
					domains: ['http://localhost:8080'],
					factory: 'Fake',
					dependency: '/about/feature/seo/fake-locations/'
				}]
			}
		}
	}
}
</pre>
<p>
	Note the two arrays: domains and locations. There is a many-to-many connection between them, such
	your application can support many domains, many location groups, and apply different locations groups
	to different domains. This is because Prudence allows for multiple virtual hosting, so that each
	application may very well be running on different domains at the same time, and may want to present
	itself differently to search engines on each domain.
</p>
<p>
	If you don't need to support virtual hosting, ignore the domains array and domains parameters:
	it will be assumed that your locations are to be applied to all domains.
</p>
<p>
	You then route the SEO resources for the application in its routing.js:
</p>
<pre>
document.executeOnce('/diligence/feature/seo/')
Diligence.SEO.routing()
</pre>


<h3>Locations</h3>
<p>
	Locations are configured using Diligence's plug-in library, which uses the factory pattern to generate
	plug-ins. In our first locations config, we used the "Explicit" factory, which is built-in to the
	SEO feature. This lets use explicitly list our locations as arrays within the config. Obviously,
	this is useful only for very small sites with a known list of URLs. 
</p>
<p>
	The "name" field is important: this becomes exactly the name of the URL set as it appears in the
	site map. As for exclusions and inclusions: they are lumped into robots.txt.
</p>
<p>
	More interesting is our second locations config: it uses our own factory, which we called "Fake".
	This factory generates lots and lots (300,000) fake locations, and is useful for testing out very
	large site maps. (Bottom line: it takes about 7 seconds to generate the complete, gzip-compressed 7-page
	site map for that many URLs.) It's also a good example for you to use to create your own location
	factories. 
</p>
<p>
	The key to factory success is understanding the <a href="../../foundation/iterators/">Diligence iterators library</a>: as long as you keep
	your iterator properly fed, you should be able to scale to site maps of scary sizes. 
</p>
<p>
	One more thing to note is that each locations config will be executed simultaneously on its own
	tasks thread, and this is true for all locations configs on all applications which you include in
	your root application, as detailed below.
</p>


<h3>The Root Application</h3>
<p>
	At minimum, the settings.js of the root application should look something like this:
</p>
<pre>
predefinedGlobals = Sincerity.Objects.flatten({
	diligence: {
		feature: {
			seo: {
				domains: [{
					rootUri: 'http://localhost:8080',
					applications: [{
						name: 'My Application',
						internalName: 'myapp'
					}],
					delaySeconds: 100,
					dynamic: false,
					staticRelativePath: 'sitemap-local',
					workRelativePath: 'sitemap-local'
				}]
			}
		}
	}
}
</pre>
<p>
	You'll see that we added a few more fields to our domain config: beyond the root URI,
	we are also configuring our robots.txt here, which we will be hosting, and configuring
	the paths to use for static generation. The static path is relative to the application's
	/web/static/ directory, while the work path will be under your application's root
	directory's "work" subdirectory. Alternatively, you can use "staticPath" or "workPath" to
	provide absolute paths. For example, you might prefer to use "workPath: '/tmp/sitemap'".
</p>
<p>
	Note that these paths are per domain: if you hosting multiple domains via virtual
	hosting, each site map should go to a different path.
	Via a simple <a href="http://threecrickets.com/prudence/manual/handlers/#filters">capturing filter</a>
	we make sure that each domain gets it correct site map. Thus, the outside world doesn't
	actually see these static subdirectories: the URI space for the site map all appears,
	publicly, at the root.
</p>
<p>
	The truly magical field is "applications": this is an array of application names for
	which locations will be added to this domain. The URL sets for each application for this
	will be merged into the main site map, and its exclusions/inclusions will be merged into
	robots.txt. It's up to you to make sure that URL set names from all
	applications don't overlap, since their files are all moved into the same static
	directory.
</p>
<p>
	The root application can also have its own "locations" field,
	which will also be merged in. We omitted it in this example for simplicity.
</p>
<p>
	To have your site map generated regularly, put something like the following in your <a href="http://threecrickets.com/prudence/manual/tasks/#toc-Subsection-54">application's crontab</a>
	(as a single line). In this example, we're having our site map generator run every
	day at 4:00AM:
</p>
<pre>
0 4 * * * /diligence/eval/ document.executeOnce('/diligence/feature/seo/'); SEO.getDomain('http://localhost:8080').generateStatic();	
</pre>
<p>
	You then route the SEO resources for the root application in its routing.js:
</p>
<pre>
document.executeOnce('/diligence/feature/seo/')
Diligence.SEO.routing(true)
</pre>
<p>
	Well, one tiny little convenience here: though you do need to install the routes in your
	root application, you are free to host the SEO resources on another app (works via the magic
	of Prudence's <a href="http://threecrickets.com/prudence/manual/routing/#toc-Subsubsection-100">router.captureOther</a>).
	So, we can call SEO.install(true, 'myapp').
</p>
<p>
	...And do all of the SEO stuff on myapp, even though it's not at root. The root application
	really doesn't have to do anything else.
<p>
	Optionally, you can also <a href="http://threecrickets.com/prudence/manual/static-web/#toc-Subsection-55">register the ".gz" extension</a>
	to serve the gzip MIME type. Search engines would not really care, but it makes your URI-space more correct and debuggable. 
	Do this in the application's default.js:
</p>
<pre>
document.executeOnce('/diligence/feature/seo/')
Diligence.SEO.registerExtensions()	
</pre>
<p>
	And that's pretty much it!
</p>
