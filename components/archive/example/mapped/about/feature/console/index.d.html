<h1>Diligence's Console Feature</h1>
<p class="note">
	Still working on documenting this feature, though it's otherwise pretty complete!
</p>
<p>
	In the meantime, why not go ahead and <a href="<%= conversation.pathToBase %>/console/">play with the console</a>.
	Note that, obviously, you do not have access it on the Three Crickets site! You will have to install
	Diligence yourself in order to use it.
</p>
<p>
	Refer to the <a href="<%= conversation.pathToBase %>/api/?namespace=Diligence.Console">Diligence.Console API documentation</a>
	for more details.
