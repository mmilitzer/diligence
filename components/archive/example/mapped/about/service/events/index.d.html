<h1>Diligence's Events Service</h1>
<p>
	Every framework provides some generic way to send, listen to and fire one-way messages
	called "events". By decoupling event producer code from event consumer code, you can better
	organize your code architecture.
</p>
<p class="note">
	...Or not. The problem with events is that they are hooked up dynamically while the
	application runs. It's hard to know, simply looking at the code, what code will be
	triggered when an event is fired. Decoupling is a great way to introduce some really
	difficult bugs into your codebase. It's best not to use events if you don't actually
	need them!
</p>
<p>
	Some frameworks go a step beyond simple code decoupling, and treat producers
	and consumers as separate <i>components</i>, where the producer cannot make
	any assumptions on the consumer's thread behavior. For example, a consumer might
	respond to events immediately, in thread, possibly tying up the producer's
	thread in the process. Or, it might have events queues up, and poll occassionally
	to handle them. In such highly generic situations, events are called "messages," and
	implementations often involve sophisticated middleware to queue messages, persist them,
	create inter-dependencies, and make sure they travel from source to destination via
	repeated attempts, back-off algorithms, notifications to system administrators, etc.
</p>
<p>
	One size does not fit all. With Diligence, we wanted to keep events lightweight:
	we assume that your consumer and producer components are all running inside a
	Prudence container: they are /resources/ and /web/dynamic/ documents that run
	in web request threads, or /tasks/ that run asynchronously. There's thus no need
	for generic middleware, though more sophisticated, dedicated messaging middleware is out
	there and available if you need it.
	(See <a href="http://www.rabbitmq.com/">RabbitMQ</a>.)
</p>
<p>  
	On the other hand, the combination of Prudence Hazelcast clusters, MongoDB, and
	JavaScript's inherent dynamism within the Prudence container allows for some
	really scalable events! If what you need is asynchronicity and scalable distribution,
	rather than generic decoupling, then Diligence events might be far more useful
	and simpler than deploying complex middleware.
</p>

	for more details.
</p>


<h2>In-Thread Events</h2>
<p>
	First, the basics. Here's our "/libraries/politeness/acknowledgements.js":
</p>
<pre>
Diligence.Events.subscribe({
	name: 'payments.successful',
	fn: function(name, context) {
		logger.info('User {0} has paid us {1}!', context.username, context.amount)
		Acknowledgements.sendThankYou(context.username)
	}
})
</pre>
<p>
	Then, to fire the event, somewhere in our payments workflow:
</p>
<pre>
document.executeOnce('/libraries/politeness/acknowledgements/')
	
Diligence.Events.fire({
	name: 'payments.successful',
	context: {username: user.name, id: user.id, amount: payment.amount}
})
</pre>
<p>
	For this to work, you have to make sure the firing code has already run the
	code that hooks up the listeners. Often, a simple document.execute will do the
	trick, like in this example.
</p>
<form method="POST">
	<p><%= Diligence.HTML.input({name: 'type', value: 'in-thread', type: 'hidden'}) %></p>
	<p><%= Diligence.HTML.submit({value: 'Click to fire in-thread event'}) %></p>
</form>


<h2>Asynchronous Events</h2>
<p>
	You can easily make the listeners run outside your thread, in fact
	anywhere in your Prudence cluster:
</p>
<pre>
Diligence.Events.subscribe({
	name: 'payments.successful',
	dependencies: '/politeness/acknowledgements/',
	fn: function(name, context) {
		logger.info('User {0} has paid us {1}!', context.username, context.amount)
		Acknowledgements.sendThankYou(context.username)
	}
})
</pre>
<p>
	Note that we added "dependencies" to the listener, to allow it to be called
	in different contexts. These dependencies are document.executedOnce to make sure
	the thread has access to all the code it needs. 
</p>
<p>
	Firing it:
</p>
<pre>
document.executeOnce('/libraries/politeness/acknowledgements/')

Diligence.Events.fire({
	name: 'payments.successful',
	async: true,
	context: {username: user.name, id: user.id, amount: payment.amount}
})
</pre>
<form method="POST">
	<p><%= Diligence.HTML.input({name: 'type', value: 'async', type: 'hidden'}) %></p>
	<p><%= Diligence.HTML.submit({value: 'Click to fire async event'}) %></p>
</form>
<p>
	And... that's pretty much it. Every listener will run in its own thread
	within the global pool. You can add a "distributed: true" flag to cause
	listeners to be executed anywhere in the cluster.
</p>
<p>
	How does this magic work? It's JavaScript magic:  
	<i>the listener function's source code is serialized.</i>
	The code that fires the event is called via <a href="../tasks/">Diligence's tasks library</a>.
	The task makes sure to run the dependencies and evaluate the JavaScript you stored. Voila. 
	(Serialization and eval will only occur on async events: otherwise, it's a regular function
	call.)	
</p>
<p>
	Concerned about JavaScript eval performance? Generally, it's very fast, and surely whatever overhead
	is required to parse the JavaScript grammar would be less than any network I/O that a distributed event would involve.
	If you're really worried, make sure to store as little as possible in the listener
	function. It's best to just call a function from one of the dependency
	libraries, which are already compiled and at their most efficient.
</p>


<h2>Stored Listeners</h2>
<p>
	So far so good, but both examples above require you to execute the code that subcribes
	the listeners before firing the event. Stored listeners remove this requirement
	by saving the event and its listeners in one of several storage implementations.
</p>
<p>
	For example, let's store our listeners in application.distributedGlobals, so
	that we can fire the event anywhere in the Prudence cluster:
</p>
<pre>
var globalEvents = new Diligence.Events.GlobalsStore(application.distributedGlobals, 'myevents.')
	
Diligence.Events.subscribe({
	name: 'payments.successful',
	stores: globalEvents,
	id: 'sendThankYou',
	dependencies: '/politeness/acknowledgements/',
	fn: function(name, context) {
		logger.info('User {0} has paid us {1}!', context.username, context.amount)
		Acknowledgements.sendThankYou(context.username)
	}
})
</pre>
<p>
	We can also use application.globals or application.sharedGlobals.
</p>
<p>
	One small issue is that with stored listeners is that they are inherently
	multithreaded: so, you need to make sure that they are not registered more than once,
	say by multiple nodes in the cluster, otherwise your listener code would be
	called multiple times.
</p>
<p>	
	That's what the listener "id" field is for. In fact, the "id"
	field can also be used for in-thread listeners. It also might make sense
	to set up all your stored listeners in your "/startup/" task, but it's not
	a requirement: you can install listeners whenever necessary and relevant.
</p>
<p>
	Because it's stored, firing the event does not require us to execute the listener
	code first in our thread. We can remain blissfully unaware of who or what is
	subscribed to our event:
</p>
<pre>
Diligence.Events.fire({
	name: 'payments.successful',
	stores: globalEvents,
	async: true,
	distributed: true,
	context: {username: user.name, id: user.id, amount: payment.amount}
})
</pre>
<form method="POST">
	<p><%= Diligence.HTML.input({name: 'type', value: 'stored', type: 'hidden'}) %></p>
	<p><%= Diligence.HTML.submit({value: 'Click to fire stored event'}) %></p>
</form>
<p>
	The "stores" param can also be an array, so you can fire the event on listeners from
	various stores. The in-thread store is in "Events.defaultStores", so you can concat
	that to your custom store if you want to fire the event across all stores. Or, set
	"Events.defaultStore" to your own value.
</p>


<h2>Persistent Listeners</h2>
<p>
	In the above example, the listeners would have to be re-subcribed when the application restarts,
	because it cannot guaranteed that application.distributedGlobals would keep its value.
	(Well, you <i>can</i> configure Hazelcast to persist the distributedGlobals map...)
</p>
<p>
	Let's store our listeners in MongoDB, instead (the default is to use the "events" MongoDB
	collection):
</p>
<pre>
Diligence.Events.subscribe({
	name: 'payments.successful',
	stores: new Diligence.Events.MongoDbCollectionStore(),
	id: 'sendThankYou',
	dependencies: '/politeness/acknowledgements/',
	fn: function(name, context) {
		logger.info('User {0} has paid us {1}!', context.username, context.amount)
		Acknowledgements.sendThankYou(context.username)
	}
})
</pre>
<p>
	Everything is otherwise the same. Neat!
</p>
<form method="POST">
	<p><%= Diligence.HTML.input({name: 'type', value: 'persistent', type: 'hidden'}) %></p>
	<p><%= Diligence.HTML.submit({value: 'Click to fire persistent event'}) %></p>
</form>
<p>
	You can also store events inside a specific, arbitrary MongoDB document, using "Events.MongoDbDocumentStore".
	This is a great way to keep events and their listeners (and the namespace for events) localized to a specific object
	without adding external mechnisms and storage. 
</p>
<p>
	Finally, you can create your own custom store class to store events anywhere else.
