<h1>Diligence's Notification Service</h1>
<p>
	This awesome service can handle all the notices coming out of your application, whether by email, stored in
	a MongoDB "inbox," or via your own pluggable delivery mechanism.  
</p>
<p>
	To handle very large scales, it works by first having you queue new notices (in MongoDB), and then it sends them
	asynchronously (via /tasks/ configured in crontab) to the adressees. Notifications sent to millions of users
	can be queued just once, on a "channel," which individual users can "subscribe" to. It's essentially a subscription
	system, though it also handles individually sent notices, to known users or even to on-the-fly addressees.
</p>
<p>
	Refer to the <a href="<%= conversation.pathToBase %>/api/?namespace=Diligence.Notification">Diligence.Notification API documentation</a>
	for more details.
</p>


<h2>Digests</h2>
<p class="note">
	Still working on documenting this feature, though it's otherwise pretty complete!
