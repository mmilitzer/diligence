<h1>Diligence's Gravatar Integration Library</h1>
<p>
	<a href="http://en.gravatar.com/">Gravatar</a> is a popular service for managing user avatars
	and simple profile pages by associating them with email addresses.
</p>
<p>
	It makes users happy, because they can manage their avatars for many, many services
	in one place. The user's email is hashed so that it is not made publicly available, unless the
	user chooses to put them explicitly on their profile.
</p>
<p>
	It makes site owners happy, because they can display avatars for users without having to store
	them or otherwise manage them. Additionally, new users would have their avatar immediately displayed
	without any effort on their part, and users do not like effort. If you're using the
	<a href="../../service/authentication/">Authentication Module</a> in association with the
	<a href="../../feature/registration/">Registration Module</a>, then you already have an email
	address for the user, and can immediately fetch their avatar from Gravatar.
</p>
<p>
	Worried about forcing users to use an external service? Then make Gravatar an optional fallback.
	Provide users with a way to manage avatars on your site directly, and only default to Gravatar.
</p>
<p>
	Refer to the <a href="<%= conversation.pathToBase %>/api/?namespace=Diligence.Gravatar">Diligence.Gravatar API documentation</a>
	for more details.
</p>


<h2>Let's Do It</h2>
<p>
	Just enter an email address, and let the Diligence magic happen.
</p>
	
<form method="POST">
	<p><%= Diligence.HTML.input({name: 'email', value: email}, {_content: 'Email address:'}) %></p>
	<p><%= Diligence.HTML.input({name: 'size'}, {_content: 'Avatar size (1-512, defaults to 80):'}) %></p>
	<p><%= Diligence.HTML.submit({value: 'Fetch'}) %></p>
</form>

<h3>Display Name: <%= displayName %></h3>
<p>
	<a href="<%= gravatar.getProfileUri() %>">
		<%= gravatar.img(conversation.form.get('size')) %>
	</a>
</p>

<p>
	The avatar above is hyperlinked to their Gravatar profile page. 
	And here's the complete JSON dump of their profile: 
</p>
<pre>
<%= Sincerity.JSON.to(profile, true) %>
