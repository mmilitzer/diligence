<h1>Diligence's Sencha Integration Library</h1>
<h2>Ext Direct</h2>

<p>
	<a href="http://www.sencha.com/products/extjs/extdirect">Ext Direct</a>
	is Ext JS's super straightforward RPC mechanism. It generates a client-side namespace for
	you full of asynchronous methods, and all you have to do is call them. Operations are batched
	for maximum efficiency, and errors are handled as elegantly as can be.
</p>
<p>
	With Diligence, you get a seamless flow from client to server and back again, because you're
	always in JavaScript: the client call and the server function definition match exactly.
	If you close your eyes, you can even imagine that the client is calling the server function
	directly.
</p>
<p class="note">
	Ext Direct is convenient and elegant but, like all web RPC mechanisms, it works by tunneling
	through HTTP, instead of working fully with it. That means that you don't get the advantages of
	conditional HTTP: if you call the same Ext Direct method twice, you will generate an action
	on the server. Logically, it's what you want happening with a method call: such calls are always
	"non-idempotent." However, if your intention is to use Ext Direct in order to access data,
	it is strongly recommended that you use REST instead: even a simple Ext.Ajax.request call (with
	cache override disabled: "disableCaching: false") may scale better.
</p>

<h3>Demo</h3>
<p>
	We've implemented a server-side stored shopping cart. Nothing is stored on the client here,
	and it's accessed with a very convenient client-side API. The server uses a hashset to make
	sure items cannot be added more than once.
</p>
<h4>Current Shopping Cart Contents</h4>
<p id="shopping-cart">
</p>
<p>
	New item: <input id="item" value="elephant" />
	<button id="add-item" disabled="true">Add to shopping cart</button>
	<button id="get-items" disabled="true">Refresh shopping cart</button>
</p>
<p>
	Try using Firebug to see all the communication with the server. It's neat!
</p>


<h3>Behind the Scene</h3>
<p>
	The server side code:
</p>
<pre>
var ShoppingCart = function() {
	var Public = {
		addItem: function(x) {
			return items.add(x)
		},
		
		getItems: function() {
			return JVM.fromCollection(items)
		}
	}
	
	Sencha.exportMethods({
		methods: Public,
		clientParentNamespace: 'Diligence',
		clientNamespace: 'ShoppingCart',
		dependencies: '/about/integration/sencha/shopping-cart/'
	})
	
	var items = JVM.newSet(true)
	
	return Public
}()
</pre>
<p>
	Note the use of Sencha.exportMethods(): we simply give it an object with our methods, and it handles the Ext Direct wiring.
	The exports are registered into a simple MongoDB collection. The 'dependencies' field is important, because it tells Diligence
	how to find our methods when the client wants to call them: they are document.executed. And, of course, these functions are
	entirely normal and can be called on the server as is, with the same namespaces. A single API for servers <i>and</i>
	clients. Hooray for Ext Direct!
</p>
<p>
	Also note our use of a JVM thread-safe set: this implementation is fully concurrent.
</p>
<p>
	The client side code:
</p>
<pre>
function refresh() {
	Diligence.ShoppingCart.getItems(function(provider, response) {
		if (response.type == 'exception') {
			Ext.Msg.alert('Shopping Cart', 'Exception: ' + response.message);
		}
		else {
			var items = response.result;
			Ext.fly('shopping-cart').update(items.join('; '));
		}
	});
}

function init() {
	refresh();
	
	Ext.fly('add-item').set({disabled: null}, false).on('click', function() {
		var item = Ext.fly('item').getValue();
		if (!item) {
			Ext.Msg.alert('Shopping Cart', 'Enter an item first!');
			return;
		}
		Diligence.ShoppingCart.addItem(item, Ext.bind(function(provider, response) {
			if (response.type == 'exception') {
				Ext.Msg.alert('Shopping Cart', 'Exception: ' + response.message);
			}
			else {
				if (response.result) {
					Ext.Msg.alert('Shopping Cart', 'Added "' + this + '" to your cart!');
					refresh();
				}
				else {
					Ext.Msg.alert('Shopping Cart', 'You already have "' + this + '" in your cart!');
				}
			}
		}, item));
	});
	
	Ext.fly('get-items')set({disabled: null}, false).on('click', refresh);
}

Diligence.loadRemoteProvider({
	namespace: 'Diligence',
	success: init
});
</pre>
<p>
	Note that we use Diligence.loadRemoteProvider() to dynamically initialize our client-side namespace, although we
	could also hard-code the description into our client file. Because we're loading it dyamically, we're
	being careful to not actually use the namespace until we have it initialized, which will call our init().
	Even the buttons that use this API will be disabled until the API is loaded.
</p>
<p>
	Also note that (obviously) all function calls are asynchronous, and that we are careful to deal with
	exceptions and failures. This is the one significant difference between server- and client-side calls to the
	same methods. However, we agree with Ext JS's decision to enforce this: RPC is always asynchronous, and
	you should code for that situation. You cannot afford to be lazy with the very real possibility of network
	failure.
