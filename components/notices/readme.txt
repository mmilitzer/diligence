Diligence
=========

Diligence is a collection of ready-to-use code to help you tackle much of the dreary work
required for building massively multi-user web applications. It relies on and fully
embraces Prudence and MongoDB, two platforms designed from the ground-up for REST-friendly
scalability. With Diligence you can quickly get users logging in, accessing data based on
permissions, subscribing to email notifications, shopping and paying you, interacting with
each other, and managing their own content on your site. It lets you cleanly integrate with
third party technologies and services, from Ext JS and Sencha Touch to Facebook. 

A comprehensive manual is included in this distribution, in the "/reference/manuals/"
directory.

It is also available online, on the Diligence web site:
