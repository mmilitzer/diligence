<h1>Diligence Examples</h1>

<p>
	Welcome to Diligence!
</p>
<p>
	This application is designed to help you learn how to use Diligence.
	It is designed as a collection of live examples for every single Diligence feature and service.
	Together with each example, we've also included the relevant chapter from the Diligence Manual,
	and provided a link to the example's source code, as well as the relevant API documentation. 
</p>
<p>
	To navigate, use the menu on the left. When reading the manual, a small floating menu will
	appear at the bottom right to help you move between sections.
</p>
<p>
	There's a <i>lot</i> of information here, and it may be overwhelming! Where to start?
	This really depends on what has drawn you to Diligence in the first place. So, let make a few
	suggested itineraries:
</p>


<h3>Using Diligence to Create a CMS-Like Web Application</h3>
<p>
	Diligence contains several building blocks for this. The most important is the
	<a href="example/service/documents/">Documents Service</a>. You'll then want to
	look at the higher-level features, the <a href="example/feature/wiki/">Discussion Feature</a>,
	the <a href="example/feature/wiki/">Wiki Feature</a> and the <a href="example/feature/blog/">Blog Feature</a>.
	Also of immediate use are the <a href="example/service/syndication/">Syndication Service</a> and
	the <a href="example/service/linkback/">Linkback Service</a>.
</p>


<h3>Using Diligence to Create Social Networking Web Application</h3>
<p>
	Start with the <a href="example/service/authentication/">Authentication Service</a> to see
	how you can allow social networking users to login to your application. Also check out
	<a href="example/integration/gravatar/">Gravatar Integration</a>.
</p>


<h3>Using Diligence to Create an Ext JS or Sencha Touch Web Application</h3>
<p>
	This is a rich area of Diligence, and support for these client-side frameworks is very
	comprehensive. Start with the <a href="example/integration/sencha/">Sencha Integration</a>
	page, and move form there to exploring the features you need. It will lead you
	to also exploring the <a href="example/service/rest/">REST Service</a> and the
	<a href="example/service/rpc/">RPC Service</a>
</p>


<h3>Using Diligence to Create a RESTful API over MongoDB</h3>
<p>
	You want to start with the <a href="example/service/rest/">REST Service</a>, which can
	automatically create a URI-space around your MongoDB database.
