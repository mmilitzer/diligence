<h1>Log Panel</h1>
<p>
	This panel at the bottom of the screen usually shows you the last lines of the log file
	and refreshes its view every 3 seconds.
</p>
<p>
	You can toggle auto-refreshing using the "Freeze" button.
</p>
<p>
	You can also travel backward and forward in the log using the arrow buttons. When you start
	traveling, auto-refresh automatically freezes, so you may want to un-toggle "Freeze" when
	you're done traveling.
</p>
<p>
	Looking for something in particular in the log? Use the "Grep" area to enter a regular expression
	with which to filter the log file. (This works by grepping the log file into the server's temporary
	directory.) Grep stays active while auto-refreshing. It's live grep!
</p>
<p>
	Switch to a different log file using the combo box at the bottom right, either choosing one of the
	available options or typing in your own. The path is relative to your container's "/logs/" directory.
</p>

<h1>Code Panel</h1>
<p>
	Type in your JavaScript code with friendly syntax coloring, and click "Execute" to evaluate
	your code on the server. 
</p>
<p>
	By default all of the Diligence, Prudence, Sincerity and MongoDB namespaces are already available to you,
	so you can use APIs having to "document.execute" the libraries first.
</p>
<p>
	The "logger" variable is initialized using Prudence's logging library, providing you with
	a quick way to see the results of your code right in the console's log panel:
</p>
<pre>
var name = 'World'
logger.info('Hello, {0}', name)
</pre>
<p>
	You can also return full textual representations to the console: simply set the "representation"
	variable to your value. If a representation is made available by your code, the console will popup
	a window with the result. Use newline characters ("\n") to return multiline representations:
</p>
<pre>
representation = 'Hello, World!\nHello, other world!'
</pre>
<p>
	As shortcuts, you can use the print() and println() functions to append anything to the representation.
	Arguments will be implicitly stringified.
</p>
<p>
	Click "Execute and Download" to download this representation via your browser. By default, it is
	a plain text file named "console.txt", but you can change this using Prudence's standard API.
	For example, let's download a CSV file to be opened by spreadsheet software:
</p>
<pre>
println('1,2,3,4')
println('5,6,7,8')
println('9,10,11,12')
conversation.mediaTypeName = 'text/csv'
conversation.disposition.filename = 'transactions.csv'	
</pre>

<h1>Saved Programs Window</h1>
<p>
	Click "Save Program" to store your program for later. Programs are stored in MongoDB's "programs"
	collection. Note that using the same program name again will override your stored program. 
</p>
<p>
	Double-click on a program name in the "Saved Programs" panel in order to load it into your
	code panel.
</p>
<p>
	Click "Rename" to rename it. Click "Delete" to delete it.
</p>
